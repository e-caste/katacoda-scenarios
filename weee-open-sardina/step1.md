### Automatic setup

**Please wait while we set up the environment for you.**  

### Configuring the script (optional)

After the commands have run, you can click on the following command to edit your configuration `vim config.py`{{execute}}. Use h,j,k,l to move around, i to go into Insert mode, ESC to go to normal mode and save the file writing :wq and Enter.    
If you want to simply see the file, run `cat config.py`{{execute}}  
Bear in mind that a default token is provided, so you won't need to paste a new one in `config.py`.  
**Warning**: if you do not have a full keyboard, like on a smartphone, the ESC button won't be available and you won't be able to exit the editor. If you're stuck, click the + at the top, then "Open New Terminal".

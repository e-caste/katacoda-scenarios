After the script has run successfully, you can click on the + tab at the top, then "View HTTP port 80 on Host 1" to open the `nginx` web browser in another browser tab, where you can see the generated .svg graphs.  
**Warning**: if you try doing so before having run the script, you will get a 404 error.

### Automatic setup

**Please wait while we set up the environment for you.**  

### Viewing the website

After the script has run successfully, you should see the message `NGINX started: listening on http://localhost:80`. At this point, you should be able to see a development instance of the WEEEhire-ng in the top panel. If not, click on the "Display port" button.  
You can then navigate to any path, since the authentication is disabled for development.  

If you want to open the development website in its own browser tab, click the + tab at the top, then "View HTTP port 80 on Host 1"

**Note**: you cannot navigate to http://localhost, because the host is the Katacoda virtual machine, not your computer.
